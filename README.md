# PI-Scheme-VM
Tools to run a VM consisting of Raspbian, SISC, and OpenJDK8

##In order to run this VM, you will need to install:

- QEMU [Download](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

##If on Windows, I recommend also downloading the following packages to be able to run the script file instead of manually pasteing it in (Still working on script):

- WGet for Windows [Download](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm)
