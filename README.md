# PI-Scheme-VM
Tools to run a VM consisting of Raspbian, SISC, and OpenJDK8

## In order to run this VM, you will need to install:

- QEMU [Download](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

## If on Windows, I recommend also downloading the following packages to be able to run the script file instead of manually pasteing it in (Still working on script):

- WGet for Windows [Download](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm)

# Running VM via Scripts

First clone this repository to a folder of your choosing and then run the command:
```
./run_Maclinux.sh (Mac or Linux)
./run_Windows.bat (Windows) Not Done
```


# Running VM Manually (without scripts)

- Download the updated Raspbian image and save it as "1.img" in a folder of your choosing. Remember the path of the folder. It is needed later.
